# Improvements

## Frontend

I tried to make all links from the websites within the iframe open in the iframe but didn't succeed. At the moment, if redirection occurs from any source other than an `<a>` element within the iframe, such as JS events, the link opens in a new tab instead of staying within the iframe.

## Backend

I didn't try to include some style to make the page look good as I felt like this wasn't the goal but I could easily improve this. I could implement better error handling.
